# Recipe Website Makeover - Complete Starter Package

##  What's Included

This package contains everything students need for Exercise 4:

### Files Created:
- `index.html` (5.0K) - Complete HTML structure with terrible styling
- `css/styles.css` (6.4K) - Intentionally awful CSS that needs transformation
- `assets/js/app.js` (11K) - Full JavaScript functionality (working perfectly)
- `assets/js/recipes-data.js` (14K) - 10 sample recipes with all data
- `README.md` (8.4K) - Comprehensive documentation for students

### Key Features:
- **Fully Functional Website** - All JavaScript works perfectly
- **Terrible Visual Design** - Bright magenta/yellow colors, tiny fonts, poor layout
- **Complete Recipe System** - Search, filter, favorites, modal views
- **Mobile Responsive** (sort of) - Basic breakpoints but ugly implementation
- **Local Storage** - Favorites persist between sessions
- **No Code Comments** - Clean code without giving away solutions

### The Problems (What Students Must Fix):
1. **Hideous Color Scheme** - Magenta background, yellow headers, cyan buttons
2. **Microscopic Fonts** - 3px to 8px text that's impossible to read
3. **Broken Layout** - No proper grid, elements scattered randomly
4. **Poor Mobile Experience** - Technically responsive but unusable
5. **No Visual Hierarchy** - Everything looks equally unimportant
6. **Ugly Forms** - Search and filters look completely broken
7. **Terrible Image Sizing** - 50px recipe photos that look amateur
8. **No Hover Effects** - Buttons provide no visual feedback

### What Works Perfectly (Students Focus on CSS Only):
- ✅ Recipe search and filtering
- ✅ Category buttons and sorting
- ✅ Favorites system with local storage
- ✅ Modal popup for recipe details
- ✅ Section navigation
- ✅ All interactive functionality
- ✅ Data loading and display

## Student Challenge:
Transform this disaster into a modern, beautiful recipe website using only CSS!
