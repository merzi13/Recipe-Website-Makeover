## CSS Areas to Focus On

### Layout & Structure
```css
/* Use these selectors to improve layouts */
.recipe-grid { /* Recipe card container */ }

```css
/* Style buttons and forms */
.search-input { /* Search box */ }
.filter-btn { /* Category buttons */ }
.favorite-btn { /* Heart buttons */ }

```

### Responsive Design
```css
/* Already has basic breakpoints - improve them! */
@media (max-width: 768px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media (max-width: 480px) { /* Mobile */ }
```

## Suggested Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (30 minutes)
1. **Fix the color scheme** - choose 3-5 professional colors
2. **Improve typography** - readable fonts and proper sizing
3. **Add proper spacing** - margins and padding throughout

### Phase 2: Layout (1 hour)
1. **Implement CSS Grid** for recipe cards
2. **Use Flexbox** for navigation and card internals
3. **Create responsive breakpoints** for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Phase 3: Visual Design (1 hour)
1. **Style recipe cards** attractively
2. **Improve forms and buttons** with modern styling
3. **Add hover effects** and visual feedback

### Phase 4: Polish (30 minutes)
1. **Add smooth transitions**
2. **Optimize mobile experience**
3. **Final testing and adjustments**

##  Testing Your Changes

1. **Save your CSS file**
2. **Refresh the browser** to see changes

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px
- Make text readable without zooming
